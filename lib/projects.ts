      solution: 'Chose MongoDB for its flexible schema design, allowing each business to customize lead structures without database migrations. This enabled rapid prototyping and quick iteration based on user feedback.',
      architecture: 'Built a RESTful API with Express and Mongoose for schema validation. Implemented pipeline status tracking with optimistic updates on the frontend for instant user feedback. Used MongoDB indexes on frequently queried fields (status, createdAt) to keep API responses under 100ms.',
      learned: 'Balancing flexibility with data integrity. While schemaless databases offer speed, I learned to enforce critical validations at the application layer using Mongoose schemas to prevent data inconsistencies.',

      solution: 'Built a web app where trainers create workouts, clients log sets/reps/weight in real-time, and progress is automatically visualized with line charts. Chose Chart.js for responsive graphs that work on mobile since clients log workouts at the gym on their phones.',
      architecture: 'Built with Next.js API routes and MongoDB for the backend. Each workout stores an array of exercises with sets/reps/weight. Implemented date-range filtering so users can view progress over weeks or months. NextAuth.js handles authentication with role-based access (trainer vs client). Deployed on Vercel with MongoDB Atlas.',
      learned: 'The importance of mobile-first design for real-world use cases. Built for mobile from day one since 90% of logging happens on phones at the gym. Also learned about TypeScript type definitions with Mongoose schemas and handling authentication state across API routes.',

      challenge: 'Event planning involves multiple complex workflows (guests, budget, vendors, tasks, timeline, notes) that need to feel cohesive, not like six separate apps duct-taped together. The interface needed to be clean and intuitive for wedding planning while remaining functional.',
      solution: 'Built a reusable component architecture where each module (Dashboard, Timeline, Guests, etc.) shares the same design language and interaction patterns. Created a unified color system (indigo and coral) with consistent spacing, typography, and animation timing.',
      architecture: 'Adopted a mobile-first responsive approach using Tailwind CSS breakpoints throughout. Every component was designed for small screens first, then enhanced for desktop. Used Framer Motion strategically for micro-interactions (hover states, transitions) that enhance usability without overwhelming users. TypeScript provided type safety across all components, catching bugs before runtime.',
      learned: 'The importance of design systems in larger applications. Early on, I was writing one-off styles for each feature, which led to inconsistency. I learned to establish a design system first (colors, spacing scale, animation timing) and build components that compose together naturally. This made the codebase more maintainable and the user experience more cohesive.',
